What could we add to the class below to access the instance variable @volume?

class Cube
  def initialize(volume)
    @volume = volume
  end
end

Because there is no attr_reader or attr_accessor called on @volume, we need to manually create a getter method.  To do this we could write a method:

    def volume
      @volume
    end
