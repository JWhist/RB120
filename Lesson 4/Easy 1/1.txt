Which of the following are objects in Ruby? If they are objects, how can you find out what class they belong to?

    true
    "hello"
    [1, 2, 3, "happy days"]
    142


All of them are objects, and the class can be determined by using the Object#class method.  

true.class => TrueClass
'hello'.class => String
[1,2,3,'happy days'].class => Array
142.class => Integer
