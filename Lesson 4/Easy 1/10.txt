If we have the class below, what would you need to call to create a new instance of this class.

class Bag
  def initialize(color, material)
    @color = color
    @material = material
  end
end

Because the initialize method here expects two parameters, you would need to call:

Bag.new('Red', 'Burlap')

or some other combination of appropriate values for the arguments.
