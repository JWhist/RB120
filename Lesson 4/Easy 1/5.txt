Which of these two classes has an instance variable and how do you know?

class Fruit
  def initialize(name)
    name = name
  end
end

class Pizza
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

the Pizza class has an instance variable denoted by the @ in front of the variable 'name' set in the intialize method to parameter 'name'.  You could also identify the class variables by the various attr_* calls in the class.
