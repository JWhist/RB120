How could you change the method name below so that the method name is more clear and less repetitive?

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def self.light_information
    "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a colour of green"
  end

end

Just call it 'info' or 'information'.  You should avoid using the class name at the beginning of the class method since it is redundant to type it out:

Light.light_information vs Light.information
