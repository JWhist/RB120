If we have these two methods:

class Computer
  attr_accessor :template

  def create_template
    @template = "template 14231"
  end

  def show_template
    template
  end
end

and

class Computer
  attr_accessor :template

  def create_template
    self.template = "template 14231"
  end

  def show_template
    self.template
  end
end

What is the difference in the way the code works?

There is no functional difference, however the create_template method in the first class accesses the @template variable directly, while the second class uses the setter method created by attr_accessor.
