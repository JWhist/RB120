If I have the following class:

class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end

Which one of these is a class method (if any) and how do you know? How would you call a class method?

Television::manufacturer is a class method, as it is defined using the 'self' keyword, it will be called upon the class itself - akin to writing 'Television.manufacturer'.  This is how it is called in practice:

Television.manufacturer (preferred) or 
Television::manufacturer
