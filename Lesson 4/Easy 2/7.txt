If we have a class such as the one below:

class Cat
  @@cats_count = 0

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
    @@cats_count += 1
  end

  def self.cats_count
    @@cats_count
  end
end

Explain what the @@cats_count variable does and how it works. What code would you need to write to test your theory?

Each time a Cat object is instantiated, the @@cats_count class variable is incremented by one.  This keeps a running count of total Cat objects created.  Cat::cats_count class method is used as a getter method to return the value of @@cats_count.  This code could be tested as follows:

Cat.cats_count  => 0
kitty = Cat.new('stray')
Cat.cats_count => 1
kitty.cats_count => Error, undefined method etc.
paws = Cat.new('Siamese')
Cat.cats_count => 2
