You are given the following code:

class Oracle
  def predict_the_future
    "You will " + choices.sample
  end

  def choices
    ["eat a nice lunch", "take a nap soon", "stay at work late"]
  end
end

What is the result of executing the following code:

oracle = Oracle.new
oracle.predict_the_future

A new Oracle object is created and assigned to the variable 'oracle'.  Then the Oracle#predict_the_future method is invoked on that object.  This method returns a string consisting of "You will " and the result a sample of the return array from the Oracle#choice method.  No explicit print or puts call is made though, so nothing will be noticed by the user.
