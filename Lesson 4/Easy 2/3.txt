How do you find where Ruby will look for a method when that method is called? How can you find an object's ancestors?

module Taste
  def flavor(flavor)
    puts "#{flavor}"
  end
end

class Orange
  include Taste
end

class HotSauce
  include Taste
end

What is the lookup chain for Orange and HotSauce?

You can call the 'ancestors' method on the objects class.  In this case:

Orange.ancestors
HotSauce.ancestors

or if you have an object 

orange = Orange.new
orange.class.ancestors
