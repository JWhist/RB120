If we have this class:

class Game
  def play
    "Start the game!"
  end
end

class Bingo < Game
  def rules_of_play
    #rules of play
  end
end

What would happen if we added a play method to the Bingo class, keeping in mind that there is already a method of this name in the Game class that the Bingo class inherits from.

Any Bingo object calling the 'play' method would be calling the Bingo#play method.  Any Game object calling the 'play' method would be calling the Game#play method.  The Bingo method would override the Game method.
